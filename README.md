# data.govt.nz data.json schema
The data.json metadata schema used to harvest datasets from agencies on data.govt.nz 

Part of moving to the CKAN data portal is improving our adaoption of international standards that aid in interoperability. One of these is the data.json standard that was put together as part of the US Project Open Data initiaive and has since been adopted by many other countries as a consistent way to express stocktakes of open data at an agency level.

The idea here is to replace the current and dated ATOM/RSS feed standard which is no longer fit for purpose as it:

 - is not able to represent individual file level resources for example you might have a csv, kml, shp file of the same data set.
 - is over 7 years old and bespoke as was put together at a time pre-these international standards didn't exist.
 - is not able to be harvested automatioacally into the the new CKAN data portal without some major work.
